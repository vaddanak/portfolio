You are on the island of Knights and Knaves. During your journey, you have come to a fork in the road and are faced with two individuals, one at each path. Each individual is coercing you to take their path. One individual is telling the truth and the other is telling a lie.

Mike is at one fork in the road and Victor is at the other. Depending on what each of the individuals say, you should choose a path to follow. If you follow the path of the liar you will be led on a journey that leads to your death. 

NOTE: Various inputs are paradoxes and will not be tested

INPUT FORMAT
Input will be in the form:

v = victor is telling the truth

==============================
ALGORITHM

If mike is a knight, then he tells the truth and victor is "as is"
If mike is a knave, then he lies and we interpret what he says about victor as
false, ie the opposite he of what he says would be correct.

Examine mike's line:
	if m is 1, then v is "as is"
	if m is 0, then v is not "as is", that is, the opposite is true.
	
Examine victor's line:
	if v is 1, then m is "as is"
	if v is 0, then m is not "as is"

Compare both lines:
	if both m's are same and both v's are same:
		if m and v are different, then take the name with value of 1
		if both m and v are same, then u
	if the m's are different or v's are different, then u

/**
* Purpose: This tests class BunchOfGraphs implementation.
* Precondition: Class BunchOfGraphs and associated members were defined
*     and implemented.
* Postcondition: Operations on creating instances of graphs and running
*     Dijkstra's algorithm were performed.  Results of finding path through
*     each graph instance can be found in file "output.txt"
*   
*     NOTE:  The "input.txt" contains data for all instances of graph.
*            The format of this file must be strictly adhered according to
*            project description.  This program is designed to retrieve all
*            the data from the "input.txt" file and create all instances of
*            Graph based on the data.

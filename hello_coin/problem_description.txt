A coin is tossed a finite number of times. Given the total number of flips, F, calculate the probability of getting at most H heads. Assume that the coin is fair (probability of heads and tails is equal).

INPUT FORMAT
The first line of the input will be, N, the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 10
The subsequent N lines will be in the form:
F H

Where:
F = Total number of flips. 1 ≤ F ≤ 100
H = Upper bound on number of heads. 0 ≤ H ≤ F

OUTPUT FORMAT
The output must be the probability of getting at most H number of heads. 
All probabilities should be rounded to the nearest four decimal places.

================================
ALGORITHM

Calculate probability formula for each H, up to H
Formula is (n_choose_r) * (p)^r * (1-p)^(n-r)
For example, 10 2
step 1:  do "10 choose 2", which is 10!/(2! * (10-2)! )
step 2:  find (.5)^2 * (.5)^(10-2)
step 3:  multiply step 1 and step 2

Follow step 1 - step 3 three times, for H=0, H=1, and H=2.
Add the results for H=0, H=1, and H=2 to get probability of seeing "at most"
2 heads when you do 10 trials, that is, 10 flips.

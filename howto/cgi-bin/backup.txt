Python -- ImportError: No module named pymysql

Traceback (most recent call last):

Solution was to copy pymysql folder into /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

Git rebase

git rebase ssh/solo incorporate changes in branch solo in base of
branch master and branch master uncommon changes are on top or in front;
master still points to its own latest change, which sits on top or in front.

"vad@vad-MD2614u:~/challenges$ git status
On branch master
Your branch and 'ssh/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 2 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

nothing to commit, working directory clean

When you have resolved this problem, run "git rebase --continue".
If you prefer to skip this patch, run "git rebase --skip" instead.
To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run "git rebase --abort"."

I did "git diff" to view the conflict and resolved the conflict.

It took 4.25 seconds to enumerate untracked files. 'status -uno'
may speed it up, but you have to be careful not to forget to add
new files yourself (see 'git help status').
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Git merge

git merge ssh/solo put branch solo changes on top or in front of
branch master uncommon branches; master now points to latest solo change.

git branch -a --> to view local and remote branches; known by "git pull"
git log ssh/solo -3 --> to view latest 3 commits on remote "solo" branch
git config pull.default simple to same branch track local-to-remote-repo

Main master branch wants to get changes present in solo branch.

"vad@vad-MD2614u:~/challenges$ git merge ssh/solo
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy. ...and other junk...

Local repository is up-to-date, but remote repository at ssh/master is behind.

========================================
Enable Python3 features in Python2

from __future__ import print_function to use 
	print(..., sep=' ', end='\n'...)
from __future__ import division all division between int values result in
	a float, ie 10/2 = 5.0; floor division // always return int, rounded down.
from __future__ import absolute_import to enable full Python 3.X package
	import semantics.	
from __future__ import unicode_literals you can use this idiom to make all
	string literals in a module unicode strings; same as add a u prefix to the
	text literal; makes string literals unicode.  Mark all binary literals with
	a b prefix, use a u prefix or __future__ import statement for text literals
	
Once you have fully translated your code to be compatible with Python 3, you will
want to make sure your code doesnâ€™t regress and stop working under Python 3. This
is especially true if you have a dependency which is blocking you from actually
running under Python 3 at the moment.
	
To help with staying compatible, any new modules you create should have at least
the following block of code at the top of it:

from __future__ import absolute_import
from __future__ import division
from __future__ import print_function
from __future__ import unicode_literals	
	
You should also use io.open() for opening files instead of the built-in open()
function as the io module is consistent from Python 2 to 3 while the built-in
open() function is not (in Python 3 itâ€™s actually io.open()).	

You can also run Python 2 with the -3 flag to be warned about various compatibility
issues your code triggers during execution. If you turn warnings into errors with
-Werror then you can make sure that you donâ€™t accidentally miss a warning.

If you only need to support Python 2.6 or later there is also from __future__
import unicode_literals. This will turn all string literals in the file into
Unicode literals:

>>> from __future__ import unicode_literals
>>> type("A standard string literal")
<type 'unicode'>
>>> type(b"A binary literal")
<type 'str'>

The binary data type is called str and the text type is called unicode
under Python 2, while under Python 3 they are called bytes and str.

>>> from __future__ import unicode_literals
>>> import sys
>>> if sys.version_info < (3,):
...     text_type = unicode
...     binary_type = str
... else:
...     text_type = str
...     binary_type = bytes
>>> isinstance('U\xf1ic\xf6de', text_type)
True

The website files are all contained in this "howto" directory.  

The purpose of this application is to create a personal knowledge base to hold
my own "frequently asked questions" that arises in pursuit of my daily interests.

I had setup an Apache server and MySQL server on my laptop and created a
virtualhost to run this application.  So I would access it by using a url like 
"localhost/index.html"

There's a module called "pymysql" for Python3 which needs to be available.

Frontend is index.html with supporting files howto.css and howto.js.

The backend files are located in "cgi-bin" folder.  File "topics" is a pickled
file created using module "shelve".

Files in folder "js" are jQuery and jQuery user-interface libraries that are
the publicly available and free and open ones.

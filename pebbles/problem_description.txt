Oz has a bag filled with many pebbles of different color groups. If C is defined as the number of all the different colors in the bag, help him calculate the probability of picking a pebble of a certain color, A(color), during his first attempt.

INPUT
X1 X2 X3 ...... Xc
A(color)

OUTPUT
O(probability)

Where:

C = maximum list index of total color groups
X [ ] = list of number of pebbles in each color group
A(color) = index indicating the chosen color group. 1≤ A ≤ C
O(probability) = probability of picking a pebble in the A(color) group. 0 < P ≤ 1

Round (floor) your answers to the nearest two decimal places.

SAMPLE INPUT
5 6 20 5
3

SAMPLE OUTPUT
0.55

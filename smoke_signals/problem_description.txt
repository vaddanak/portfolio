Two Computer Engineers who are stranded on an island. They decide to split up to evaluate their resources and use smoke signals to communicate while on different sides of the island. Fortunately for them they know ASCII and are able to encode their binary sequence of smoke signals into ASCII. 

Complete a program which converts a binary sequence to ASCII.

NOTE: No ASCII table will be provided

INPUT FORMAT
Input will be in the form:
B

Where:
B = Binary sequence 

OUTPUT FORMAT
Output should be the string in ASCII format

Sample 1:

SAMPLE INPUT
10010001101001

SAMPLE OUTPUT 
Hi

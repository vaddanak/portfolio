Sharp - Practice Question
This practice question has been created by Nitish Mittal (Teaching Assistant) for course MITx 6.00.1x Summer 2015 on edX. This is in reference to week 3 course material.
You must have heard about factorial (5!), square root(root 5), etc of a number. Let us assume there exists an operation “#” on integers greater than equal to 2 such that for any integer x >= 2, 

x# = ((((((2 ^ 3) ^ 4) ^ 5)  …)  …)     x-1) ^  x)

For example ->
2# = 2
3# = (2 ^ 3) = 8
4# = ((2 ^ 3) ^ 4) = (8 ^ 4) = 4096

Write a function “sharp(x)” that takes an integer ‘x’ as argument and gives out the value of x#. 

Suppose num_digits(x) represents the number of digits in the integer x, give the value of "result" where,

result = num_digits(7#) + 2 * num_digits(6#) + num_digits(5#) + num_digits(4#)

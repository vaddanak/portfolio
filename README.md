samples of personal work
 
Hi,

Thank you for visiting.  My name is Vaddanak Seng.  This repository represents a portfolio of personal 
original work.  The source codes were completed for school projects and personal coding ideas 
and contests.

As I strive to challenge myself daily and learn new skills, I will add new content to this repository.

Thank you again for visiting, and I hope any part of this repository was found to be insightful and useful.

Sincerely,
Vaddanak Seng
